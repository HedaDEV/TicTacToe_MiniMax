# Tic Tac Toe Minimax Simulation and Visualization

This project includes a Python script that simulates a game of Tic Tac Toe between two AI players and visualizes the Minimax decision-making process.

## Features

- **AI vs AI**: Simulates a full game of Tic Tac Toe between two AI players, each making moves based on the Minimax algorithm.
- **Minimax Visualization**: Generates a visual representation of the decision tree used by the Minimax algorithm in Tic Tac Toe.

## Usage

1. **Simulate AI vs AI Game**: To see how two AI players compete against each other using optimal strategies, run the `ai_vs_ai()` function.
2. **Visualize Decision Tree**: To understand the decision-making process of the Minimax algorithm, run the `draw_minimax_tree()` function.

Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed, including `matplotlib` and `networkx`.

## Packages Installation

With pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib networkx
